# Component Model

How this repo is carved up, and the rules that keep each piece extractable.

The repo is deliberately structured as a set of loosely coupled components rather
than one application. Not every component will survive, and some will outgrow this
repo and be promoted into their own project or handed to another team. That is an
expected outcome, not a failure — so the layout is designed to make extraction a
move operation rather than an untangling exercise.

This is the structural expression of decision 2 in `docs/decision-log.md`
("decouple KG core from the integration layer"). That decision said the core must
not know about its consumers; this document is how the filesystem enforces it.

## Components

| Component | Responsibility | Status | Likely language |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kg-core` | Schema contract, validation, query/traversal logic. Knows nothing about Confluence, Rovo, or Claude. | Schema drafted | Kotlin if it grows into a service; scripts fine while exploring |
| `kg-content` | The curated graph itself — entity files conforming to the schema. Data, not code. | Empty | n/a (Markdown + YAML) |
| `confluence-ingest` | Inbound. Reads existing Confluence pages and helps turn them into candidate entities. One-off-ish migration aid. | Not started | Whatever is fastest; this is throwaway-shaped |
| `confluence-publish` | Outbound. Generates one structured page per entity and publishes to the dedicated space. | Not started | Kotlin or scripts |
| `query-service` | v2. Network-reachable query interface so cloud-hosted Rovo can reach the graph. Deployed via TAP/CTAP. | Deferred | Kotlin |
| `claude-code-access` | Local access glue so Claude Code can read and traverse the graph from the filesystem. | Not started | Scripts |

## Dependency rules

The only rule that really matters: **dependencies point inward, toward
`kg-core`.**

```
confluence-ingest ─┐
confluence-publish ─┼─→ kg-core ←─ (reads) ─ kg-content
query-service     ─┤
claude-code-access ┘
```

- `kg-core` depends on nothing in this repo. If it ever needs to import from a
  component that talks to Confluence, the abstraction is wrong.
- `kg-content` is data. It conforms to the schema but does not depend on code, and
  nothing should require code to be readable.
- **Integration components never import each other.** `confluence-publish` and
  `query-service` both need to read the graph; both go through `kg-core`, not
  through each other. This is the rule most likely to be broken under time
  pressure, and the one whose violation costs the most later.
- Shared behaviour that two integrations need belongs in `kg-core`, or it is not
  shared behaviour.

## Contracts

Each component owns a `README.md` stating its purpose, its boundary, what it
depends on, and what would be involved in extracting it. That README is the
contract; if a change makes the README wrong, the change needs to update it.

Cross-component communication happens through the schema and the filesystem, not
through internal function calls. Concretely: a component reads entity files (or
calls `kg-core`), and never reaches into another component's internals. This keeps
the eventual transport swap — local file reads becoming HTTP calls to
`query-service` — a change in one place.

## Promotion criteria

A component is ready to be promoted out of this repo when all of these hold:

1. It has a stated, stable contract that consumers rely on.
2. It depends only on `kg-core`'s contract, not on its internals.
3. It has its own tests, and they pass without the rest of the repo present.
4. It needs its own release cadence, deployment lifecycle, or ownership — this is
   the actual trigger; the first three are readiness, not motivation.

`query-service` is the most likely first candidate, because it is the only
component that must be deployed and promoted through
`development → staging → production` on the org path. Deployment lifecycle is
exactly the kind of pressure that justifies a separate project.

`kg-content` is the least likely to move but the most valuable to keep clean — it
is the asset. Tooling is replaceable; the curated graph is not.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **A shared `utils` or `common` component.** It becomes the coupling everything
  routes through, and it is never extractable. Duplicate a little instead.
- **Integration logic leaking into `kg-content`.** Confluence page ids in
  frontmatter are the deliberate exception, and even that is written by tooling
  rather than by hand.
- **Building `query-service` early.** It is deferred for good reasons; a
  network-reachable service with no stable schema behind it is churn with
  deployment ceremony attached.
- **Splitting a component before it has a second consumer.** Boundaries drawn
  from speculation are usually wrong. The six here are drawn from decision 2's
  distinctions, which are grounded in real differences of direction and
  lifecycle — not from guessing.
