# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A local, git-versioned knowledge graph (KG) that curates Tyro's architecture
knowledge — principles, guardrails, patterns, reference architectures, decisions —
as the grounding source for the Architecture stream's Rovo agent (AI uplift
program), replacing raw Confluence RAG over 100+ inconsistent pages.

**Status: design phase.** A schema draft and component scaffolding exist; no code,
build system, or test suite is committed. Do not invent or assume build/lint/test
commands; there are none. If asked to add tooling, choose per the org language
standards (Kotlin preferred for complex applications).

## Layout

```

docs/backlog.md           parked feature ideas, not yet decided or scheduled
docs/component-model.md   component boundaries, dependency + promotion rules
components/kg-core/       schema contract (SCHEMA.md), validation, traversal
components/kg-content/    the curated graph — entity files, data only
components/confluence-ingest/    inbound: Confluence pages → draft entities
components/confluence-publish/   outbound: entities → generated pages
components/query-service/        v2, deferred — do not build yet

## Working with the user

**Challenge ideas rather than agreeing** — especially at planning stage. The
strongest honest objection is the useful contribution; an objection grounded in the
user's own stated design lands harder than an appeal to external policy. Once a
decision is made and reaffirmed, implement it well rather than relitigating it.

**Read `meta/procedural-memory/lessons.md` before substantial work.** It holds
mistakes already made on this project. Four of its rules are short enough to state
here, because violating them is expensive: never put a credential in a command line;
test an environment hypothesis before proposing a change to the user's config; after
a denied tool call, ask rather than retrying a variant; run any code that derives
paths or does index arithmetic in the same turn you write it.

`meta/` observes the process of building the project rather than participating in
it. **`components/` must never depend on `meta/`** — that would tie an extractable
component to this project's history. The repo's only executables live here —
`token-tracking/summarize.py`, `architecture-learning/reindex.py`, and
`architecture-learning/extract_transcript.py`, all stdlib only.

`meta/architecture-learning/` is two layers: append a line to `observations.md`
during a conversation (no read needed), and promote to `principles/<slug>.md` only
when a pattern repeats. Read `INDEX.md` — not the principle files — to decide
whether something is new; it is generated, so run `reindex.py` after any frontmatter
change. Every entry needs cited evidence and a `stated`/`inferred` marker; an
uncitable entry is a projection and reads as authoritative anyway. Prefer recording
*how* a decision was reached, and which counter-arguments were accepted, over
recording conclusions — a profile that only reproduces conclusions cannot push back,
and pushback is wanted.

Entries are tracked hypotheses or preferences, not settled conclusions — see
`principles/evidence-over-assumed-best-practice.md`. Tag each piece of evidence
`**Supports.**` or `**Contradicts.**`, and set `status`
(`active`/`reinforced`/`contested`/`revised`/`abandoned`) to match what the evidence
actually shows. `reindex.py` refuses to build the index if a principle has
`contradict > 0` without an acknowledging status — never leave a contradicted
principle at `active`/`reinforced`.

`meta/token-tracking/summarize.py --by branch` gives per-feature cost. Compare
tasks on `output` and `cache_wr`, never on cache reads — those scale with
conversation length, not with work done.

Each component's `README.md` states its purpose, boundary, dependencies, and
extraction notes, and is treated as its contract — if a change makes a README
wrong, update it in the same change.

## Working conventions

- **`docs/decision-log.md` is the primary artifact and a living doc.** It records
  problem, goal, decisions, constraints, open questions, and next steps. When a
  design decision is made, changed, or reversed in conversation, append/update it
  there — decisions are explicitly marked tentative and open to revision, so
  editing existing entries is expected, not just appending.
- **Project state lives in the repo, not in Claude's memory.** Claude's own
  cross-session memory (under `~/.claude/`) is for lessons about how Claude
  should work — corrected preferences, procedural mistakes to avoid — never for
  facts about this project's design or status. Any change to the project or
  decision made in conversation must be written into the repo in the same
  turn: `docs/decision-log.md` for decisions, constraints, and open questions;
  `docs/backlog.md` for deferred feature ideas; a component's `README.md` when
  its purpose, boundary, or dependencies change. If it isn't in one of those
  files, it didn't happen, as far as the next session (or a teammate) is
  concerned.
- **Two more background habits, easy to let slide in a long session.** Before
  treating a substantial turn as finished, check whether anything in it
  qualifies for `meta/architecture-learning/observations.md` (append, no
  ceremony — see that component's README) or `meta/procedural-memory/lessons.md`
  (a mistake worth a rule — see that component's README). Both are described in
  full elsewhere in this file; this bullet exists because the habit has already
  been observed to lapse across a whole session without a reminder. Treat a
  session with no entries in either file as something to ask about, not as
  quiet evidence that nothing qualified.
- **Roadmap and milestone scope changes need explicit approval, not just
  good reasoning.** Both the program's phase/milestone roadmap
  (`docs/program-roadmap.md`) and the local three-step integration plan
  (decision 6 in `docs/decision-log.md`) are explicitly flexible if discovery
  changes priorities — but that's a reason to propose a change and ask, never
  to edit the committed phases/milestones unilaterally on the strength of a
  good argument. Flag it, wait for a clear yes, then write it down.
- Keep prose wrapped to ~80 columns to match the existing files.
- `.idea/` is gitignored (JetBrains); it is present locally but not tracked.

## Architecture of the intended system

Four decisions shape everything and should be treated as the current baseline
(all recorded in `docs/decision-log.md`, all revisable). Cite them by name rather
than by number — the log is appended to and renumbering silently breaks
cross-references:

1. **File-based storage, not a graph DB.** Markdown + YAML frontmatter, git
   versioned. PR review is the quality gate. Revisit a graph DB only if traversal
   needs outgrow flat-file lookup.
2. **KG core is decoupled from the integration layer.** Core = schema + storage +
   query logic. Integration layer = Confluence ingest inbound, Confluence publish
   + Rovo grounding outbound, and local access for Claude Code. Design so that
   swapping local file reads for a deployed query service is a transport change,
   not a redesign. `docs/component-model.md` is how the filesystem enforces this:
   dependencies point inward to `kg-core`, and integration components must never
   import each other — that rule is the one most likely to be broken and the most
   expensive to unpick.
3. **Confluence is an output, not the source of truth.** Curate in git → generate
   one structured page per entity → publish to a dedicated clean Confluence space
   → Rovo indexes that space. Architects edit git, never raw Confluence.
4. **Components over one application.** Six components under `components/`, sized
   so that pieces which outgrow this repo can be promoted out as a move rather
   than an untangling. Plus a `meta/` tier that observes the project without being
   part of it. See the Layout section above.

The graph shape is the point: typed relationships (`pattern REQUIRES guardrail`,
`principle CONFLICTS_WITH pattern`, `decision SUPERSEDES decision`,
`system USES pattern`) are what enable contradiction detection and dependency
tracing that flat RAG can't do. Preserve that capability in any schema proposal.

## Key constraint: Rovo is cloud, the KG is local

Rovo cannot reach this repo. Anything Rovo queries must be network-reachable,
which means going through the org deployment path (TAP/CTAP via Schooner/
Jetstream, GitOps/ArgoCD, promoted development → staging → production via
Drydock). This is deliberately deferred to v2 and does not block work on the KG
core.

## Atlassian MCP

`docs/decision-log.md` lists the connector's capability as an open question —
whether it can invoke the Rovo agent or only do Confluence/Jira CRUD. Verified
against the live tool list: **CRUD and search only, no Rovo agent invocation.**
The connector exposes Confluence page read/create/update/search (CQL), Jira issue
read/write/transition (JQL), Compass components, and Teamwork Graph
context/search. There is no tool that runs or directs the Rovo agent itself.

Two consequences for design work:

- The git → Confluence publish path (Confluence-as-output) can be driven from
  Claude Code via `createConfluencePage` / `updateConfluencePage`; it does not
  need a separate deployed integration to get started.
- Grounding Rovo still has to go through Rovo indexing the published Confluence
  space. There is no MCP shortcut, which reinforces the v2 deferral above.

Re-check the tool list rather than trusting this section if connector behaviour
seems to differ.
