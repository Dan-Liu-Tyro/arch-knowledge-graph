# kg-content

The curated graph itself: one Markdown file per entity, conforming to
[`../kg-core/SCHEMA.md`](../kg-core/SCHEMA.md).

This component is data, not code. It is also the actual asset — every other
component is replaceable tooling, whereas the curated knowledge here is the thing
that took human judgement to produce.

## Layout

```
entities/
  principles/               <slug>.md
  guardrails/               <slug>.md
  patterns/                 <slug>.md
  reference-architectures/  <slug>.md
  decisions/                <slug>.md
  systems/                  <slug>.md
```

Filename stem is the entity id. The containing directory carries the type, so ids
are unprefixed.

## Boundary

**In scope** — entity files, and nothing else.

**Out of scope** — scripts, templates, generated output, or Confluence artefacts.
If something here is not a curated entity, it belongs in a tooling component.

## Depends on

The schema contract only. Deliberately readable without any tooling present: a
human should be able to open a file and understand it, and a reviewer should be
able to judge a change from the diff alone. That property is what makes PR review
viable as the quality gate.

The one concession to tooling is `confluence_page_id` in frontmatter, written by
`confluence-publish` so the git → Confluence mapping travels with the entity.
Never hand-edit it.

## Status

Empty. The schema needs pressure-testing against three real entities that exercise
the typed relationships — a principle, a guardrail deriving from it, and a pattern
requiring that guardrail — before bulk authoring starts.

## Extraction notes

Unlikely to move, but if it does it moves cleanly, because it has no code
dependencies by construction. The realistic scenario is the opposite direction:
this repo becomes the canonical content home and tooling gets promoted out around
it.
