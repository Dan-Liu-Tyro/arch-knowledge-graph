# architecture-learning

An accumulating, evidence-based model of how one architect reasons — built from
working on this project, and built on a specific epistemic stance: no position
recorded here is treated as settled. Each one is a hypothesis or a preference,
tracked individually over time, and revised or abandoned when evidence says so. See
[`principles/evidence-over-assumed-best-practice.md`](principles/evidence-over-assumed-best-practice.md)
for the reasoning — the position that "there is usually a best practice, but it's
unclear whether it's visible in advance" is itself the entry that governs how every
other entry is written.

**Deprioritised on the consumption side**, by explicit instruction: no consumer is
wired up, and it should not absorb a turn for its own sake. But recording continues
as conversations happen, because the evidence is only capturable while it is fresh.

## Structure

```
INDEX.md                generated routing table — the only file read on a normal session
observations.md         append-only raw capture, one line per observation
principles/             one file per principle, carrying its own evidence
reindex.py              regenerates INDEX.md from principle frontmatter
extract_transcript.py   condenses a session transcript for audit/backfill
```

## Why split, and why not for the reason you might expect

The single-file version cost ~2,200 tokens to read, which is nothing. Projected to
100 entries it would be ~22,000 — real, but a future problem. **Token cost is not
the strongest argument for splitting today.** Two structural facts are:

**Evidence accumulates far faster than principles do.** After many sessions there
may be a hundred observations behind a dozen principles. A flat file mixes the
high-volume, low-judgement stream with the low-volume, high-judgement conclusions,
so both get harder to work with: capture feels heavyweight, and the principles get
buried in their own supporting material.

**Capture and curation want different costs.** Capturing should be nearly free, or it
won't happen mid-conversation and the evidence is lost. Promotion should be
deliberate, because a principle asserted from one weak instance is exactly the
projection this component exists to avoid. One file forces both through the same
gate; two layers let each have its own.

The token saving is real and follows from getting that structure right — it is the
consequence, not the motive.

## The access pattern this is designed around

Every session asks one question: *the user just did or said X — is that new evidence
for an existing principle, a new principle, or not durable?*

Answering it needs the **statements** of existing principles and none of their
evidence. So:

| Operation | Reads | Cost today |
|---|---|---|
| Capture an observation | nothing — shell append | ~0 |
| Decide new vs. existing | `INDEX.md` only | ~550 tokens |
| Add evidence to a principle | one principle file | ~250 tokens |
| Promote an observation | `INDEX.md` + write one file | ~700 tokens |
| Export everything to a consumer | all principle files | ~2,200 tokens, and only when exporting |

Compare the flat file, where every one of those cost a full read. The index is 4×
cheaper than the old file *already*, at only ten principles.

## Hypotheses, not conclusions

Every entry is one of two **forms**:

- **`hypothesis`** — a testable belief about what will work. Can be reinforced by
  repetition, and genuinely *contradicted* by an outcome that goes the other way.
  "Curation over accumulation" predicts something checkable: does the review gate
  actually catch bad content, or get bypassed under pressure?
- **`preference`** — a stated value with no outcome to check. "Decisions are
  artifacts" isn't refuted by any future event; it can only be abandoned if the
  user later says they no longer want it. Preferences still move — `abandoned`
  replaces `refuted` for this form — but nothing "disconfirms" a preference the way
  an outcome disconfirms a hypothesis.

Conflating the two produces exactly the failure the tracking system exists to
avoid: treating a taste as if it had been tested, or treating a tested belief as if
it were merely a taste.

Every entry also carries a **status**, which is the thing that is actually allowed
to change as evidence comes in:

| status | means |
|---|---|
| `active` | One instance so far. Not yet tested again. |
| `reinforced` | Repeated supporting evidence, no contradiction. |
| `contested` | Both supporting and contradicting evidence exist. |
| `revised` | Superseded by an updated version of the same position — kept, not deleted, for the record. |
| `abandoned` | Evidence, or a later statement, undermined it enough that it's no longer held. |

**The bar for creating a principle file is low; the bar for calling it `reinforced`
is not.** Write one down the first time an observation looks worth watching, even
from a single instance — that's what `status: active` means. Repetition earns
`reinforced`. Confidence language (`strong`/`moderate`) is gone; it invited exactly
the premature certainty this redesign exists to remove.

## Working practice

1. **During a conversation**, append to `observations.md`. One line, no ceremony.
   Do not stop to decide whether it matters.
2. **When an observation looks worth tracking**, read `INDEX.md`. If it agrees with
   an existing principle, open that file, add a `- **Supports.**` bullet, and
   increment `support` in its frontmatter. If it disagrees, add a
   `- **Contradicts.**` bullet, increment `contradict`, and update `status` to
   `contested` (or `revised`/`abandoned` if the disagreement is decisive) — do not
   leave a contradicted principle at `active`/`reinforced`; `reindex.py` will refuse
   to build if you do. If it's genuinely new, write a new principle file at
   `status: active`.
3. **Append a line to that file's `## Status history`** whenever status changes,
   with the date and a one-line reason. This is the literal timeline the tracking
   exists to produce.
4. **Run `python3 meta/architecture-learning/reindex.py`** after any frontmatter or
   heading change. The index is generated so it cannot drift, and it refuses to
   build if contradicting evidence isn't acknowledged in `status` — see the module
   docstring.
5. **Mark the observation** with `supports:<id>` or `contradicts:<id>`, or leave it
   `unpromoted`. Unpromoted is the honest default.

## Audit and backfill from transcripts

Live capture (above) is the default and should stay near-zero-cost. This is the
deliberately separate, occasional counterpart: a detached pass over past session
transcripts to catch what live capture missed, run whenever, decoupled from
whatever task is active in the current session.

**Source.** Claude Code writes one `*.jsonl` transcript per session to
`~/.claude/projects/<slugified-project-path>/*.jsonl` — the same files
`meta/token-tracking/summarize.py` already reads for cost data. The slug is the
absolute repo path with `/` replaced by `-`; for this repo that directory is
`-Users-bliu-code-claude-workspace-arch-knowledge-graph`. Verified present
2026-08-19: four files, dating back to this project's first session on 2026-08-17.

**Process.**
1. List the transcripts in that directory. Each filename is a session UUID with
   no human-legible summary — use `ls -la` for dates/sizes as a first filter, and
   expect to open a few to identify which ones matter.
2. Run `python3 meta/architecture-learning/extract_transcript.py <path>` per
   transcript. This strips tool payloads, `thinking` blocks, and sidechain
   (subagent) traffic by default, leaving only the user/assistant dialogue —
   read this output, not the raw transcript.
3. Read the extract against `INDEX.md` (not the principle files) the same way a
   live observation would be checked: new evidence for an existing principle, a
   new principle, or genuinely not durable.
4. Backfill into `observations.md` and the relevant principle file(s) exactly as
   the live working-practice steps above describe, then `reindex.py`.

**Things to watch out for.**
- **Cost is real here, unlike live capture.** Reading and interpreting a
  transcript after the fact costs input and reasoning tokens; there is no free
  shell-append step. Batch this rather than running it per session.
- **Retention is unverified, not guaranteed.** All that's confirmed is that four
  files exist today going back to project start. There's no known rotation or
  cleanup policy for `~/.claude/projects/`, so an audit run today may not be able
  to reach sessions that were possible to audit last week — treat this as
  best-effort recovery of whatever still exists, not a permanent archive to rely
  on for anything durable.
- **The directory name is derived from the repo's absolute path.** If the repo is
  ever moved or renamed, its slug changes and older transcripts stay filed under
  the old slug — an audit that only looks at the current project's directory
  will silently miss them. Check for other `-Users-bliu-...` directories whose
  name is a plausible earlier path if a gap in history is suspected.
- **Sidechain (subagent) messages are excluded by default.** `extract_transcript.py`
  drops any record with `isSidechain: true` unless run with
  `--include-sidechains`. Subagent work can contain genuine evidence too, but
  mixing it into the primary dialogue by default made early testing harder to
  read.
- **Cross-check before writing.** Several existing `observations.md` entries were
  already backfilled from these same early sessions when this component was
  first built. Check an extract against existing entries before adding — the
  goal is to catch what's missing, not to duplicate what's already there.

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
id: curation-over-accumulation      # matches filename stem
kind: architectural | working       # subject matter: substance vs. process
form: hypothesis | preference       # epistemic status — see above
status: active | reinforced | contested | revised | abandoned
type: stated | inferred             # said outright, or observed from choices
support: 2                          # count of supporting evidence items
contradict: 0                       # count of contradicting evidence items
updated: 2026-08-18
---
```

`reindex.py` fails loudly on a missing field, and on a `contradict > 0` /
`status: active` mismatch, rather than emitting a partial or dishonest index.

Deliberately **not** the KG schema from `components/kg-core/SCHEMA.md`, even though
the shapes are close. Using it here would be a cheap way to pressure-test that schema
against real content without touching org material — worth doing, but as a decision
taken on purpose, not by drifting the two formats together.

## Two things this must not become

**Do not merge into `kg-content`.** That holds Tyro's canonical architecture
knowledge and publishes to Confluence for others to rely on. This holds one person's
style. Merging would promote personal preference to organisational canon.

**Do not optimise for agreement.** A profile that only reproduces conclusions is a
cache, and a perfectly aligned model cannot challenge its subject — which is the
explicit requirement here. So principle files record *how* a decision was reached,
and status-history entries that describe a challenge-and-reaffirm episode (e.g.
`curation-over-accumulation.md`) are the highest-value content, because they show
which arguments actually land.

## Evolution is tracked twice, on purpose

`## Status history` inside each file is the curated, human-readable timeline —
short, dated, one line per status change, written to be read without opening git.
`git log --follow principles/<file>` is the complete, uncurated version of the same
thing, with full diffs and authorship, and it is free. The two are not redundant:
the status history is what you read to understand *why* a position moved; git is
what you read to see *exactly what changed* if the summary isn't enough. `updated`
in frontmatter exists only so the index can be sorted, not as a substitute for
either.

## Division from the other meta components

`procedural-memory` records **my** operational mistakes and takes effect immediately
via a `CLAUDE.md` pointer. This component models **the user's** reasoning and has no
consumer yet. Session memory holds only what the user stated or corrected directly.
Same lesson never lives in two of the three.
