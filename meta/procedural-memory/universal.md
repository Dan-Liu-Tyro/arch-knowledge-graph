# Universal Procedural Lessons

Lessons distilled from working on this project whose evidence is
project-specific, but whose rule doesn't depend on anything about knowledge
graphs, Confluence, Rovo, or this repo's own tooling — candidates for manual
promotion into another project's own procedural memory or `CLAUDE.md`, if
that project turns out to need the same discipline. See
[`README.md`](README.md) for how this differs from
[`lessons.md`](lessons.md) (evidence *and* rule both specific to this
project) and from `architecture-learning` (models the user's reasoning, not
mine).

Promotion elsewhere is a deliberate, manual copy — the same "move, not
automatic reach" pattern this repo already uses when a `components/` piece
is promoted into its own project (see `docs/component-model.md`). Nothing
here propagates anywhere by itself; a future session working on another
project would need to read this file and choose to carry an entry over.

Split out of `lessons.md` on 2026-08-26: eight of that file's original ten
entries turned out, on inspection, to be general engineering/assistant
hygiene rather than anything tied to this project's domain. Worth noting on
its own — it suggests this project's actual project-specific procedural
surface is still thin, two entries' worth so far.

## Test an environment hypothesis before proposing a config change

**What happened.** `gh` failed with a TLS certificate error. I noticed
`GIT_SSL_CAINFO` pointing at a corporate CA bundle, inferred that `gh` was ignoring
it, and proposed adding `SSL_CERT_FILE` to the user's Claude Code settings. They
made the change. It did not work. `GODEBUG=x509usefallbackroots=1` did not work
either. The actual blocker was the sandbox denying Go's call into macOS
Security.framework — unfixable by any environment variable.

**Cost.** The user edited their own configuration for nothing, then reverted it to
stay aligned with org standards.

**Rule.** Before proposing a change to someone's configuration, test the hypothesis
in a way that costs them nothing — set the variable inline for one command, or probe
the failing layer directly. Propose the edit only after the probe works. And prefer
handing over a command to run in their own shell over changing their environment at
all.

---

## Don't route credentials through a command line

**What happened.** With `gh` blocked, I reached for
`curl -H "Authorization: bearer $(gh auth token)"` to hit the GitHub API. The call
was denied, correctly.

**Cost.** A denied tool call, and a request that should never have been made.

**Rule.** Never put a credential into a command line — even a local one, even the
user's own token, even via substitution. If a task appears to need a secret, ask
first and say what it will be used for.

---

## After a denial, change approach — don't retry a variant

**What happened.** A compound `git checkout main && git merge --ff-only` was denied.
I re-sent essentially the same operation with the pipeline stripped. It was denied
again.

**Cost.** Two denied calls where one should have prompted a question.

**Rule.** A denial is information about intent, not a syntax error. Ask what the
objection was, or hand the command over, rather than probing for a phrasing that
gets through.

---

## Cite by name in living documents, never by number

**What happened.** Appending a decision to `docs/decision-log.md` renumbered the
existing ones and silently broke two cross-references that pointed at "decision 3."

**Cost.** Caught only because I grepped for it; otherwise two documents would have
pointed at the wrong decision indefinitely.

**Rule.** In any append-only document, reference entries by name, not position. This
is now also stated in `CLAUDE.md`, since the log will keep growing.

---

## Label first-measurement conclusions as provisional

**What happened.** From the first token baseline I reported that cache reads were
the dominant signal. Adding cost modelling showed cache *writes* are the figure that
matters — they indicate real context change and cost 20× more per token. My earlier
framing was not wrong about the volume, but it pointed attention at the wrong number.

**Cost.** A conclusion the user might have acted on, corrected one session later.

**Rule.** A single measurement supports a description, not a recommendation. Say
which number is provisional and what would change the reading, rather than naming a
key metric on first sight of the data.

---

## Verify derived paths by running, not by reasoning

**What happened.** `summarize.py` derived the repo name from `__file__` with one
`dirname` too few, so it looked for a transcript directory named after `meta`. Pure
reasoning error in three lines of path arithmetic.

**Cost.** Small — one failed run — but it would have shipped silently if the script
had not been executed as part of the same change.

**Rule.** Run any code that derives paths, computes offsets, or does index
arithmetic, in the same turn that writes it. These are the errors that survive
careful reading.

---

## Proof-read commands the user is expected to paste

**What happened.** I gave a `git branch --set-upstream-to` command with the branch
name misspelled, and separately pasted a commit title with a typo mid-word.

**Cost.** A command that would have failed on paste, and a correction that cost a
paragraph of the reply.

**Rule.** Anything the user will copy and run gets read once more before sending. A
wrong command spends their turn, not mine.

---

## Never run a command whose output is a credential, even to debug

**What happened.** While diagnosing a `gh auth status` failure that turned out to
be the already-documented sandbox TLS block (see "Test an environment hypothesis
before proposing a config change," above — same `OSStatus -26276` error), I ran
`gh config get -h github.com oauth_token` and `security find-generic-password` to
check whether the stored token was readable. The first command printed the user's
live GitHub OAuth token in plaintext into the conversation transcript.

**Cost.** A real, live credential exposed in a transcript that may be logged or
reviewed later, for a check that didn't need the value itself — only whether a
lookup succeeded.

**Rule.** When probing whether a credential exists or is readable, check for
success some other way (exit code, a masked/boolean signal, a tool built for the
purpose) — never run the command that echoes the secret itself, even for one's own
diagnostic use, even locally. And re-check this file for a matching prior incident
before re-diagnosing a familiar-looking failure at all; this exact TLS error was
already on record.

## `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/` and `.git/config` are sandbox-write-protected

**What happened.** Merging one branch into another required git operations (a
fresh worktree checkout, then `git reset --hard`) that needed to create,
delete, or overwrite a tracked file under `.claude/agents/` as part of a
normal tree transition. Every one of those operations failed with `Operation
not permitted`, even when the target content was byte-identical to what was
already on disk — which ruled out a real merge conflict. Direct `mkdir`/
`touch` tests on the same path confirmed a sandbox write-block, not a git or
OS issue. The same class of block separately hit `git branch
--set-upstream-to` and `git push -u`, both of which write to `.git/config`.

**Cost.** Several minutes and multiple failed command retries diagnosing what
looked like a git problem before testing the path directly settled it.

**Rule.** In any Claude-Code-managed repo, expect writes to `.claude/agents/`,
`.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/settings.json` /
`.claude/settings.local.json`, and `.git/config` to be sandboxed off
entirely — by design, to stop an agent from silently expanding its own tool
grants or git remotes. This blocks any git operation that would create,
delete, or unlink a path in those directories, regardless of whether the
resulting content is a real conflict. Diagnose with a direct `mkdir`/`touch`
test on the specific path before assuming it's a real conflict, and reach
for `git update-index --add --cacheinfo <mode>,<blob-sha>,<path>` (edits only
`.git/index`, never the protected path) rather than retrying the same
checkout/reset command. A change to a file in one of these directories needs
a human hand — Claude can propose the diff but not apply it directly.
